## Simple Online Shop application

Was created to play around with Java8 streams a little bit and use them in JUnit5 framework.

## Running the Application

The Shop has been implemented as a command-line application. The main method is in Application.java.
The application uses Maven and can be run with the command:

> mvn clean compile exec:java
